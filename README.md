The USA overwhelmingly leads all other countries with a total revenue of approximately $3.36 million, accounting for more than double the revenue of the next country. This suggests that the US market is the primary driver of the company's global sales and represents a vital region for maintaining and scaling operations.

Following the USA, Spain ranks second with $1.22 million, and France is third with approximately $1.11 million in total sales. These three countries form the top tier of revenue contributors.

Countries like Australia, UK, and Italy form a mid-tier group, each generating between $370K and $630K, while the remaining countries‚Äîsuch as Finland, Norway, Singapore, and others‚Äîfall into a lower revenue tier, contributing between $57K and $330K.
